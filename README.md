# Vanilla Menu App (With CMS capability)

## A word on inheritance

In this demo we used 2 classes with some shared properties. We _can_ inherit (See <https://codepen.io/jmsherry/pen/eYJbevK> but it is not the nicest: We can also utilise 'method overrides' <https://codepen.io/jmsherry/pen/pogqGMP?editors=0011>). I've kept the classes separate here for ease of understanding.

## Growl Notifications (aka toasts, ala toastr <https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr>)

I decided not to implement them as there was only one usecase in the app. A demo of them for your apps can be found <https://codepen.io/jmsherry/pen/wvKydVE>
